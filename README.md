# Vehicle and Car Implementation

This project demonstrates a TypeScript implementation of a `Vehicle` interface and a `Car` class that adheres to this interface. The `Car` class includes methods and properties to represent a car and start its engine.

## Files

- `car.ts`: TypeScript source file defining the `Vehicle` interface and implementing the `Car` class.
- `car.js`: Compiled JavaScript file from the TypeScript source.

## Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Node.js and TypeScript installed. You can install TypeScript globally using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript

2. **Compile TypeScript Code**

- Compile the TypeScript file to JavaScript:

    ```bash
    tsc car.ts

3. **Run the JavaScript File**

- Execute the compiled JavaScript file using Node.js:

    ```bash
    node car.js

- You should see the message "Car engine started" logged to the console.
